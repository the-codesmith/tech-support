# Performance Monitoring

If I have sent you to this page to help determine how to upgrade your computer, please follow the steps below.

Install Open Hardware Monitor
---
1. Go to [Open Hardware Monitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/) and click on the download link.
2. Unzip the file that it gives you.
3. Run `OpenHardwareMonitor.exe` inside the folder that you just unzipped.

5. Leave this program open while you use your computer.

Replicate the performance issue
---
1. **STRESS TEST** your computer! Do whatever it is you normally do that causes your computer to work the hardest.
    - Note the start and end times of your test. This will make it easier to dig into the data that is being generated by Open Hardware Monitor.
    - Try to replicate the situations that you normally see issues or poor performance (such as frame drops, stuttering, lag, etc). Here are some examples of what you can make sure to do in order to replicate the situation:
      - Playing a certain game
      - Running applications that you normally have open at the same time
      - Using your computer long enough that components have enough time to heat up, especially if you have a liquid cooler
2. Close Open Hardware Monitor.

Send your results
---
1. Find a file called `OpenHardwareMonitorLog-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` (but with the current year, month, and day) in the same folder you extracted earlier where you ran `OpenHardwareMonitor.exe`.

2. Send this file to me along with the start and end time of day of your test if you kept track of them.

I will review the data and get back to you with my recommendations for computer hardware upgrades!
